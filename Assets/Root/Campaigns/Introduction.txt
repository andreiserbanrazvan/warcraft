In the Age of Chaos two factions battled for dominance.

The kingdom of Azeroth was a prosperous one.
The humans who dwelled there turned the land
into a paradise.

The Knights of Stormwind and the Clerics of Northshire
Abbey roamed far and wide, serving the King's people
with honor and justice.

The well trained armies of the King maintained
a lasting peace for many generations.

Then came the Orcish hordes...

No one knew where these creatures came from, and none
were prepared for the terror that they spawned.

Their warriors wielded axe and spear with deadly
proficiency, while others rode dark wolves as black
as the moonless night.

Unimagined were the destructive powers
of their evil magiks, derived from
the fires of the underworld.

With an ingenious arsenal of weaponry and powerful
magic, these two forces collide in a contest of cunning,
intellect and brute strength

with the victor claiming dominance over
the whole of Azeroth.
